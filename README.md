# track-o-bot-ios
Simple companion iOS app for Track-o-Bot

Universal iOS app that allows the user to manually upload games to Track-o-Bot.
Can be used, for example, when playing Hearthstone on an iPad.
Simply enter your Track-o-Bot username and API token, both of which can be found on your profile page by clicking on the "Settings" button, then on "API".

This project has just been started, so there are only minimal features:

- Add credentials
- Add games with information about heroes, coin and game results

That's it ;-) Obviously, it comes with no warranties, use at your own risk. However, if it uploads wrong game data, you can always delete games on your Track-o-Bot profile.
