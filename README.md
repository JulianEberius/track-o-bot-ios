# Track-o-Botty
Simple companion iOS app for Track-o-Bot

## NEWS: The App is not availble on the App Store anymore, on account of me not wanting to pay 99$ Apple Developer Program fees  to keep it available for just another year. Since it is open source, you can still compile and install to your device using XCode.

## More information: http://julianeberius.github.io/track-o-bot-ios

Track-o-Botty allows you to manually upload Hearthstone game results to your Track-o-Bot profile. It is ideal if you want to track your games and win rates when playing Hearthstone on an iPad or iPhone, especially if you are already using Track-O-Bot on your Windows PC or Mac. The app has the following features:

- Connect to your existing Track-o-Bot account or create a new one in the app
- Add game results with information about heroes, decks, coin, mode, rank and game results
- Check a game history view, that also allows to delete games
- See win rate graphs for classes and decks
- Directly log into and open your trackobot.com web profile

Tip: When playing on an iPad, you don't need to leave Hearthstone to use Track-o-Botty. Simply use the iPad's "Slide Over" function, as shown in the screenshot. Slide from the right edge of the screen towards the center, then choose Track-o-Botty to slide it over Hearthstone and quickly add a game result.

Note that this is an independently developed companion app using the API offered by trackobot.com, not an official Track-O-Bot product. It is also open source, so everyone can contribute at https://github.com/JulianEberius/track-o-bot-ios. Thanks to Github user "ungesehn" for contributing the logo.
