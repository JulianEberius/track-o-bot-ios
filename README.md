# track-o-bot-ios
Simple companion iOS app for Track-o-Bot

Universal iOS app that allows the user to manually upload games to Track-o-Bot.
Can be used, for example, when playing Hearthstone on an iPad.

To reuse your existing Track-o-Bot account, after installing this app, export your account data from your Desktop client ("Settings"->"Account"->"Export"), and then open the resulting file on your iOS device. This can be accomplished, for example, by sending the account data file via email to yourself, and opening the attachment on the iOS device. Another way would be using Dropbox or similar services.

This project has just been started, so there are only minimal features:

- Import account data file (credentials)
- Add games with information about heroes, coin and game results
- Basic History view
- Open web profile

That's it ;-) Obviously, it comes with no warranties, use at your own risk. However, if it uploads wrong game data, you can always delete games on your Track-o-Bot profile.
