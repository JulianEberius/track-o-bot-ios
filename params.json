  "body": "# Track-o-Botty\r\nFree iOS companion app for Track-o-Bot.com\r\n\r\nTrack-o-Botty is a universal iOS app that allows you to manually upload games to Track-o-Bot.\r\nIt is ideal if you want to track your game results when playing Hearthstone on a iPad or iPhone, especially if you are already using TrackOBot on your Windows PC or Mac.\r\n\r\nWhile you can create a new new account directly in the app, it is also possible to reuse your existing Track-o-Bot account. To do so, after installing this app, export your account data from your Desktop client (\"Settings\"->\"Account\"->\"Export\"), and then open the resulting file on your iOS device. This can be accomplished, for example, by sending the account data file via email to yourself, and opening the attachment on the iOS device. Another way would be using Dropbox or similar services.\r\n\r\nThe app has the following features:\r\n\r\n- Import account data file (Track-o-Bot profile credentials)\r\n- Add games with information about heroes, decks, coin, mode, rank and game results\r\n- Basic History view, allows to delete games\r\n- Win rate graphs for classes and decks\r\n- Open the trackobot.com web profile, export the profile credentials\r\n\r\nThat's it ;-) Obviously, since its free and Open Source, it comes with no warranties, use at your own risk (and see License information below).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is released under the GNU General Public License (LGPL) Version 2.\r\n\r\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE)\r\n\r\nThis project further includes the source code of the Charts (previously \"iOS-Charts\") library by Daniel Cohen Gindi & Philipp Jahoda, which was acquired under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) from https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts.\r\n\r\nThe icons used in the appâ€™s tab bar are part of the Themify Icon set, which was acquired under the OFL license (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL) from http://themify.me/themify-icons.\r\n\r\nThe app's main icon was contributed by Github user [ungesehn](https://github.com/ungesehn).",
